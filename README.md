# API Test

Here the goal was to get in touch with the information the API was going to give us. 

At the end, the end point was not going to provide a historical data as we expected. 

Nevertheless we practice a bit with calling this API extracting lists from the values to know what is this data, how could we use it with the CSV files that have the historical data we want. 

Conclusion: This Test told us we need to work with CSV files that contain historical data.
