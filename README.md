## The visualizations
In this branch we are creating our DB. We decided to provide the user with the visualizations in an index.html. We thought this was the best idea because we could go as deep as we want with the style of our visualization. 

The **official_db** is where up to date you can find the most relevant changes. We are almost done, but now we want to make it more interactive in the sense that the user can filter the data through time (months), so our 3 interactive charts can provide that precise visualization for the month filter applied.

## The Style 
in the final visualizations for next week, we want to present not just our bar charts, tables and pie chart, but also the idea of how this proyect is still able to provide a user with more valuable information. You can realize this when you open the files with the live server because you will find a *home page* and also some *icons* that will be helpful to give continiuty to the project.

## JS
As we mentioned, we are about to provide pur project with the final touch so the objective is to be able to filter our data through months and that our plots change.
